# Simple Tutorial for Stream Data Processing with Apache Flink.

## 1. Introduction
We will practice Apache Flink with simple activities:
* setup Apache Flink in local machine
* write streaming applications with Flink
* run Flink streaming applications
* understand relationships between developers and platform providers through tools/supports

>Note: there are many tutorials about Apache Flink that you can take a look in the Internet, e.g. [Flink DataStream API Tutorial](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/getting-started/tutorials/datastream_api.html) or [Apache Flink with in AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FIPt87A_qM)


## 2. Setup Apache Flink for Practices

Download [Apache Flink from Apache](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) and [follow the installation guide for a local machine](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/getting-started/tutorials/local_setup.html). In this simple tutorial, we use Apache Flink 1.9.1 for Scala 2.11

The example we use to run is for [the BTS data](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/bigdataplatforms/cs-e4640-2019/tree/master/data/bts) and we will use [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com) as the message broker through the streaming analytics application obtains data.

You can setup your own RabbitMQ or use a test RabbitMQ during the tutorial.

## 3. Exercises
### Check if the installation is OK
Following Flink guide to see if the installation is ok. Move into the directory of your Flink installation and start Flink:
```
/opt/flink$ bin/start-cluster.sh
```
then check the [UI](http://localhost:8081)

### Practices with Flink  SocketWindowWordCount example

You can check [the Flink example](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/getting-started/tutorials/local_setup.html) and test it to see how it works.

### BTS example

#### Check the source code and compile it
Check [the source of BTS in our Git](simplebts/). It is a simple example for illustrating purposes. The program is built with maven.
```
$mvn install
$ls target/simplebts-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
the file **target/simplebts-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar* is the one that will be submitted to Flink.

#### Test RabbitMQ with the BTS data
Before running BTS Flink, check if we can send and receive data to/from RabbitMQ. We have two python test programs in **scripts/** and the data file in **cs-e4640/data/bts**:

Start a BTS test producer:
```
export AMQPURL=**get from the tutorial or your own **
python3 test_amqp_producer.py --queue_name [your_selected_queue_name] --input_file  [cs-e4640-2019/data/bts/bts-data-alarm-2017.csv]
```
Then start a BTS test receiver:
```
export AMQPURL=**get from the tutorial or your own **
python3 test_amqp_consumer.py --queue_name [your_selected_queue_name]
```
if you see the receiver outputs data, it means that the RabbitMQ is working.

#### Run Flink BTS

Now assume that you choose two queue names:
* **iqueue123**: indicate the queue where we send the data
* **oqueue123**: indicate the queue where we receive the alert.

Run the Flink BTS program:

```
bin/flink run simplebts-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --amqpurl  [AMQPURL] --iqueue [iqueue123] --oqueue [oqueue123] --parallelism 1
```
Now start our test producer again with the queue name as **iqueue123**:
```
export AMQPURL=**get from the tutorial or your own **
python3 test_amqp_producer.py --queue_name iqueue123 --input_file  [cs-e4640-2019/data/bts/bts-data-alarm-2017.csv]
```
and then start a BTS test receiver with queue name as **oqueue123**:
```
export AMQPURL=**get from the tutorial or your own **
python3 test_amqp_consumer.py --queue_name oqueue123
```
to see if you can receive any alerts.

#### Check logs
Check the logs under **flink/log**:
* flink * taskexecutor *.log
* flink * taskexecutor *.stdout

to see errors, printout.
